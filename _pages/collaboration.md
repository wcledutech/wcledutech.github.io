# 📝 Collaboration 

I have collaborated extensively with PhD students <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BkOytCMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Yupeng Lin</a> and <a href="https://frank-haoming.github.io" target="_blank">Haoming Wang</a> from Tsinghua University, as well as Associate Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P6iOYgQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Teng Yu</a> from Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University. I also maintain close professional ties with Associate Professor Yuhui Jing of Zhejiang University of Technology, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7Go3k0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Yuanyuan Li</a> from Shanghai Normal University, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l2Lo1lYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Xiaojiao Chen</a>, an incoming Master’s student at Beijing Normal University. Furthermore, I collaborate with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JdYNWP0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Zihan Xiao</a> from the Pudong Institute of Education Development and Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TVXmoNkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Rustam Shadiev</a> from Zhejiang University. 
Additionally, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ra8fbcYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Jian Dai</a> has been a vital collaborator of mine; though he has transitioned to a direct PhD program in the School of Management, he has recently published several high-quality papers in AJG 3 journals.

Our collaboration revolves around <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cO4WHEJo2nlkxlWKzI0Yfw" target="_blank">intelligent technology-enabled programming learning</a> (instructional foundation), the <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-msDQsIz6kHtKwSwHA3k3g" target="_blank">construction of intelligent learning environments</a> (learning spaces), and the design and implementation of AI Agents. Beyond these areas, I am also interested in the transformative value of technology in language learning—a research direction rooted in my own personal experiences. Additionally, I occasionally contribute to pedagogical methodology; I have recently developed <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-023-12178-6" target="_blank">application standards for bibliometric mapping</a> and a user guide for Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), which is currently under external review.

In summary, my research begins with the construction of intelligent learning environments and the vertical design of AI Agents. It focuses on three core pillars: learner experience, behavioral modeling, and cognitive development, ultimately exploring how cutting-edge AI can empower teaching, learning, management, and assessment.

I maintain an open attitude toward collaboration; however, to ensure high-quality outcomes given my current capacity, I apply certain baseline criteria for new partnerships. Nevertheless, I welcome potential collaborators to reach out via email (wcledutech@gmail.com). I aim to make time for a brief discussion with all inquiries to efficiently explore the possibility of working together.
